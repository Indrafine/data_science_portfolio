## Introduction to time series data: -

* Time series is simply a series of data points that has a time component involved in it.It means every data point present in the dataset is associated directly with the date and time component.

* Example of a restaurant: -

* You have to predict the number of customers visiting the restaurant each day so that you can manage the staffing and supply of ingredients and vegetables accordingly.
This kind of forecasting can help the restaurant serve their customers in a much better way even in the times of uncertainty. It can also save a lot of money.
Suppose, there is very little requirement on a particular day and ordered lots of vegetables and ingredients to serve your customers but if you use time series forecasting to forecast the number of customers visiting the restaurant every day these kinds of situations can be avoided.
