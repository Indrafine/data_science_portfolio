## Technical analysis

* Technical analysis focuses on analyzing the direction of prices to predict future prices. You might have come across people drawing different lines and curves on the price chart to 
  predict the future price direction
  
* Fundamental analysis depends on analyzing unstructured textual information like financial news and earning reports. Performing fundamental analysis using machine learning techniques is quite 
  interesting as it's mostly based on analysing 
  text and sentiments.
